So what I did first was i went to chatgpt to ask it for a base template for my first page. I already had a template from the first project but I wanted something much more basic and so I was able to find a bare and bone html page with nothing and tried to take just what was easy to replicate. Once I had an idea as to what it should look like it was just getting the damn tables to work the way i wanted that was the hard part. Other than that, i would ask gpt how to do certian things like how to center a div for the 5th time(i still dont know how)
