    <td>Project 1 is a project that I made in my third year of college where I made a C program (not C++) that will act as a mini Linux shell. It is a very simple shell that can run basic commands like ls, cd, and pwd. It was a very fun project to make and I learned alot about how the shell works in Linux.</td>

    <td>Project 2 is a project where I implted the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm with priorities, and run it on specified mixes of processes. This was a fun project to work on at first but became the hardest project due to some small errors that I could not catch.</td>
